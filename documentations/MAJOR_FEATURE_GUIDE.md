| Complete Rewrite | 8+ weeks | 3+ devs | Feature Flags + Sub-Features | üî¥ High |

---

## üéØ Strategy 1: Sub-Feature Development (Recommended)

**Best for:** Most major features, team collaboration, regular feedback

### Phase 1: Planning & Architecture

#### Step 1: Feature Breakdown Document
Create `FEATURE_PLANNING.md`:

```markdown
# Major Feature: Advanced User Management System

## Overview
Complete overhaul of user management with role-based permissions, activity tracking, and advanced profile customization.

## Architecture Components
1. **User Profile System** - Enhanced user data models
2. **Permission Engine** - Role-based access control
3. **Activity Tracker** - User action logging
4. **Notification System** - User preference management
5. **Data Export Tools** - GDPR compliance features

## Sub-Feature Breakdown
| Sub-Feature | Estimated Days | Dependencies | Developer |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Enhanced User Models | 3-4 days | None | @dev1 |
| Permission Framework | 4-5 days | User Models | @dev2 |
| Activity Logging | 2-3 days | User Models | @dev1 |
| Notification Preferences | 3-4 days | Permission Framework | @dev2 |
| Data Export API | 4-5 days | All above | @dev1/@dev2 |
| Frontend Integration | 5-7 days | Data Export API | @dev3 |

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing functionality remains working
- [ ] New permission system handles 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] Activity logging has <100ms performance impact
- [ ] Data export completes within 30 seconds for average user
```

#### Step 2: Create Feature Tracking Branch
```bash
# Create main feature branch for tracking only
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/advanced-user-management
git push -u origin feature/advanced-user-management

# Create tracking document
touch FEATURE_PROGRESS.md
git add FEATURE_PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "docs: Initialize advanced user management feature tracking"
git push origin feature/advanced-user-management
```

### Phase 2: Sub-Feature Development

#### Recipe A: Starting a Sub-Feature
```bash
# Always start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create sub-feature branch
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-user-models

# Set upstream
git push -u origin feature/enhanced-user-models

# Update progress tracking
git checkout feature/advanced-user-management
# Edit FEATURE_PROGRESS.md to mark as "In Progress"
git add FEATURE_PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "docs: Mark enhanced-user-models as in progress"
git push origin feature/advanced-user-management
```

#### Recipe B: Daily Sub-Feature Work
```bash
# Daily routine for sub-feature
git checkout feature/enhanced-user-models
git pull origin feature/enhanced-user-models

# Sync with main (critical - do this daily!)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Do your work
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add user profile extended fields"
git push origin feature/enhanced-user-models
```

#### Recipe C: Completing a Sub-Feature
```bash
# Final sync before PR
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/enhanced-user-models
git rebase main

# Clean up commits (optional but recommended)
git rebase -i main  # Squash related commits

# Push final version
git push origin feature/enhanced-user-models --force-with-lease

# Create Pull Request via GitHub/GitLab
# Title: "feat: Enhanced user models with extended profiles"
# Description: Reference to main feature issue/document
```

#### Recipe D: After Sub-Feature Merge
```bash
# Update main feature branch with completed work
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Gets your merged sub-feature

git checkout feature/advanced-user-management
git rebase main  # Incorporates completed sub-feature

# Update progress tracking
# Edit FEATURE_PROGRESS.md to mark sub-feature as complete
git add FEATURE_PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "docs: Mark enhanced-user-models as completed"
git push origin feature/advanced-user-management

# Clean up
git branch -d feature/enhanced-user-models
git push origin --delete feature/enhanced-user-models
```

### Phase 3: Feature Integration

#### Final Integration Recipe
```bash
# When all sub-features are complete
git checkout feature/advanced-user-management
git pull origin main
git rebase main

# This branch should now contain integrated work from all sub-features
# Create final PR for any remaining integration work
# Or delete if no additional integration needed

# Update documentation
git checkout main
# Update main README.md with new feature documentation
```

---

## üéØ Strategy 2: Feature Flags (For Risky Changes)

**Best for:** Major rewrites, API changes, experimental features

### Implementation Recipe

#### Step 1: Add Feature Flag System
```python
# configurations/feature_flags.py
class FeatureFlags:
    # Major feature flags
    ADVANCED_USER_MANAGEMENT = False
    NEW_AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM = False
    EXPERIMENTAL_API_V3 = False
    
    @classmethod
    def is_enabled(cls, flag_name: str) -> bool:
        return getattr(cls, flag_name, False)

# Usage in code:
from configurations.feature_flags import FeatureFlags

def get_user_profile(user_id):
    if FeatureFlags.is_enabled('ADVANCED_USER_MANAGEMENT'):
        return new_user_profile_system(user_id)
    else:
        return legacy_user_profile_system(user_id)
```

#### Step 2: Development with Feature Flags
```bash
# Create long-lived feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/advanced-user-management-flagged
git push -u origin feature/advanced-user-management-flagged

# Develop behind feature flag
# ... implement new features ...

# Merge frequently to main (feature is hidden)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/advanced-user-management-flagged
git rebase main

# Create PR for incremental changes
# New code is deployed but not active for users
```

#### Step 3: Feature Flag Activation
```bash
# When ready to activate
# Update feature_flags.py
# ADVANCED_USER_MANAGEMENT = True

git add configurations/feature_flags.py
git commit -m "feat: Enable advanced user management system"
git push origin main

# Monitor in production, can quickly disable if issues arise
```

---

## üéØ Strategy 3: Parallel Development (High-Risk Features)

**Best for:** Database migrations, complete architecture overhauls

### Parallel Development Recipe

#### Step 1: Create Parallel Implementation
```bash
# Create separate implementation branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-database-architecture

# Create parallel code structure
mkdir -p database/v2/
mkdir -p api/v2/
mkdir -p models/v2/

# Implement new system alongside old
# Old system continues working
# New system is built and tested separately
```

#### Step 2: Gradual Migration
```python
# Implement dual-write pattern
def create_user(user_data):
    # Write to old system (primary)
    old_user = legacy_user_service.create(user_data)
    
    # Write to new system (secondary, for testing)
    try:
        new_user_service.create(user_data)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"New system write failed: {e}")
    
    return old_user
```

#### Step 3: Switch-over Planning
```bash
# Create migration script
# database/migrations/switch_to_v2.py

# Test thoroughly in staging
# Plan rollback strategy
# Coordinate with team for switch-over
```

## üìû Getting Help

### When to Ask for Help
- **Conflicts are complex** and you don't understand them
- **Architecture decisions** affect other team members  
- **Performance issues** in your implementation
- **Timeline is slipping** beyond 25% of estimate
- **You're unsure** about technical approach

### How to Ask for Help
```
**Subject:** Help needed: Advanced User Management - Permission Framework

**Current Issue:** 
Permission framework is causing 500ms response time in user lookup operations.

**What I've Tried:**
- Added database indexes on user_id and role_id  
- Implemented basic caching (Redis)
- Profiled queries - N+1 problem in role hierarchy lookup

**Specific Help Needed:**
- Review my caching strategy  
- Advice on role hierarchy query optimization
- Should we consider denormalization?

**Files/Branches:**
- Branch: feature/permission-framework
- Key files: models/permission.py, services/role_service.py

**Timeline Impact:**
- Originally 5 days, now on day 6
- May need 2 extra days for optimization
```
